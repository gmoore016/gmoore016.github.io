I'm currently a PhD student in the Stanford Economics department interested in education, market design, and innovation (entered fall 2022). 

Previously I worked as a Predoctoral Research Fellow with Heidi Williams at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (SIEPR) focusing on the economics of innovation. I completed my A. B. at Bowdoin College in 2019, studying Economics and Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science.

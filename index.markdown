I am currently a PhD student in the Stanford economics department interested in education, market design, and innovation. 

Prior to joining the Stanford PhD program, I worked as a Predoctoral Research Fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (SIEPR) with Heidi Williams. I completed my A. B. at Bowdoin College in 2019, studying Economics and Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science.

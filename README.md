I currently work with [Heidi Williams](https://heidi-williams.humsci.stanford.edu/) as a Predoctoral Research Fellow at the [Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research](https://siepr.stanford.edu/). In this role I focus primarily on the economics of innovation, with special interest in health care and drug development. Other research interests of mine include the economics of education and market design.
